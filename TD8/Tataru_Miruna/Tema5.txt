Tema 5 - Tataru Miruna

Peg grammar 

- starting by expecting a function
- "literal"- Match exact literal string and return it (so we will have "functie()..." to parse a String)
- we have to write the expression What's up (WHATSUP - because it is nonterminal so we use uppercase) 
- label : expression - Match the expression and remember its match result under given label, WHATSUP:expr
- same as "Tema4.txt", but if the answer is not ALF, it waits it till it is ALF
- we have to make a loop (repeat What are you doing? until ALF) - it enters the loop 0, 1, or infinite, something like 
(What are you doing?)*- in ok I tried to do something

Here is the grammar: 

start 
   = functie

functie 
   = "functie(){"WHATSUP:expr"}"{return WHATSUP;}

expr
   = "What's up?""ACTION:quest"{return "That's cool man!"+ACTION;}

quest
   = "what are you doing?""ACT:(v:hate/w:ok)"{return ACT;}

hate
   ={return "I hate ALF";}

ok
   = "What are you doing?"{return "Ok,man";}
