Peg grammar 

- starting by expecting a function
- "literal"- Match exact literal string and return it (so we will have "functie()..." to parse a String)
- we have to write the expression What's up (WHATSUP - because it is nonterminal so we use uppercase) 
- label : expression - Match the expression and remember its match result under given label, WHATSUP:expr
- we want to ask "What are you doing?, so we need to ask a question using label : quest. For exemple: ACTION:quest (like we did in functie)
- if the answer is ALF: I hate ALF!
- if not : Ok, man!
- expression1 / expression2 / ... / expressionn - Try to match the first expression, if it does not succeed, try the second one, etc. 

Here is the grammar: 

start 
   = functie

functie 
   = "functie(){"WHATSUP:expr"}"{return WHATSUP;}

expr
   = "What's up?""ACTION:quest"{return "That's cool man!"+ACTION;}

quest
   = "what are you doing?""ACT:(v:hate/w:ok)"{return ACT;}

hate
   ={return "I hate ALF!";}

ok
   ={return "Ok,man!";}
